# Experiment with Image Upload

## Steps

1. Upload an image file
   - `<input>` element restricts browser to only accept jpg and png files
   - Reads file and determines actual file type regardless of file extension
2. Crop desired area
   - Zooming in and out is supported
   - Moving image within the crop box is supported
3. Generate 3 assets (full-sized images) and show 3 smaller sized previews on screen
